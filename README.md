# Accessing-Databases-with-SQLite3-and-SQLiteMagic


To communicate with SQL Databases from within a JupyterLab notebook, we can use the SQL "magic" provided by the ipython-sql extension. "Magic" is JupyterLab's term for special commands that start with "%". Above, I have used the load_ext magic to load the ipython-sql extension. In the lab environemnt provided in the course the ipython-sql extension is already installed and so is the ibm_db_sa driver.

I have create a table, insert some data, and retrieve the results using the SQLite and SQLitgeMagic database with python in the Skills Network Lab environment.
